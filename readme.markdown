jQuery Taggable Input
----

Allows you to have an input that has "tokens" that are searchable just like a Facebook status update field.

Originally based on https://github.com/vdepizzol/jquery-tokeninput (which acted like an email token input box) but heavily modified to accept both tokens and plain text.
